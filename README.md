# ml-nb: Machine Learning Notebook
This repository contains a set of IPython Notebooks about machine learning algorithms and its applications. Some of the content is based on the [PRML Book](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2F%7Ecmbishop%2Fprml%2Findex.htm) by Christopher Bishop.

## Requirements:
The notebooks are developed with:
* Python 3
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Pandas

These libraries can be easily installed using Anaconda and Pip.

## Notebooks
1. [Parametric Density Estimation](./ParametricDensityEstimation.ipynb): Estimating a parametric density distributions.
2. [Nonparametric Density Estimation](./NonparametricDensityEstimation.ipynb): How about non-parametric density estimation.
3. [Linear Regression Models](./LinearRegressionModels.ipynb): Classic linear models for regression in a toy data.
4. [Linear Classification Models](./LinearClassificationModels.ipynb): Linear classification models applied to multi-class classification.
5. [Neural Networks](./NeuralNetworks.ipynb): Exploring non-linearity with Neural networks.
6. [Kernel Trick](./KernelTrick.ipynb): Applying the kernel trink on regression models.
